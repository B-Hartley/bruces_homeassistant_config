# Lay-Z-Spa Hot Tub

This code works with Hot Tubs that are linked to the Lay-Z-Spa app.
It does not work with Tubs linked to the BestWay Hub App.

Do you use the Bestway Hub App if you want to use this automation as once you have used it, you cannot go back.
I do now have a Bestway App version of this code if you have switched.
