This enables power monitoring smart plugs.

I have two HS110 smart plugs.

There was a firmware issue where the local unofficial API was disabled.
After pressure from the community they now offer a "beta" firmware that re-enables it if you request it.
One of my switches had been broken by this and I am waiting for the beta firmware to be applied.

They can switch on an off and also monitor power consumption.

I use one on my [washing machine](../../areas/utility/washing_machine/) to monitor how the cycle is progressing based on power usage.
It's still a bit of a work in progress and is probably a bit overcomplicated.
