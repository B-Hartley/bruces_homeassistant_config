* 2 x Zappi Chargers
* Eddi (Hot Water Immersion Diverter) - with Temperature Probe
* Harvi (for monitoring)
* Hub

Zappi chargers switch into FAST mode when the Agile electric price is below a certain level.
There are scripts to change the Zappi mode from a Drop Down.

I use REST sensors to obtain live usage data from the Harvi sensors.
