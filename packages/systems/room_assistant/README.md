# room-assistant

Using code from https://www.room-assistant.io/
Running on 7 x Raspberry pi zero-w.

Tracks iphones / apple watches and dog tracker to locate (using BLE and Bluetooth) people to the rooms that they are in.
Still a work in progress as it is not 100% accurate and would ideally triangulate position rather than picking the "nearest room"
