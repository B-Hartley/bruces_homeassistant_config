# Asleep Switches

Show if each person in the house is asleep.

An input boolean in a template switch for each person.

Generally, double clicking a flic button next to the bed turns off all lights & electric blankets for the person. 
Then marks them as asleep.

A single click in the morning turns on bedside light and marks awake.
Other triggers may change to awake and at noon all swithces reset to awake.

Some automations are in the flic automations in each room (area) directory.

The template switches allow the status to be displayed in homekit, or checked with Alexa.
